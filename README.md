# Tools for working with the [WIT IDL](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/WIT.md) and Webassembly [Components](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/Explainer.md).

WORK IN PROGRESS/EXPERIMENT

At this moment, this project offers the ability to parse some of the WIT IDL, and generate WebAssembly Text Format for components from it.  Currently working on adding support for creating component binaries, and eventually bindings so as to potentially work with/as projects like [wit-bindgen](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen)
